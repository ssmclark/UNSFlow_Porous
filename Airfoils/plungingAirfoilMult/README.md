This aerofoil is for comparison of results to "Unsteady Aerodynamics of Porous Aerofoils" by Baddoo et al. (2019).

This is a purely plunging aerofoil in constant freestream velocity with no pitching kinematics.

CHECK CALCS.JL PRIOR TO RUNNING THE SIMRUN FILE. The final surf.x term on the right-hand side must be squared. If a purely pitching aerofoil is being used, remove the squared term.

The 'Mult' suffix in the filename is due to multiple porosity values being calculated and plotted at once.
